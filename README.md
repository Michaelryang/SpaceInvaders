**Visual Demo**  
The following visual demo is a short playthrough of the three levels. To keep it short, I used the "god mode"
to clean up the invaders quickly.

**Description and Goals**  
For this project, I wanted to accomplish two main things: Provide myself a basic introduction to the Kotlin
programming language, and make a complete, playable game comprised of resources that I have made myself.
This includes animations, art, music, and of course, all the code.

The purpose of these goals is to challenge myself to learn a new language and apply it in a meaningful manner.
In addition, this project will help me understand the process behind developing a simple gameplay system that
is aided by it sounds and visuals (not hindered, which is typical for many basic game prototypes by developers).

The art style I came up with was true to its arcade roots with a clean minimal 8bit style. However, what I spent
more time on was individually creating each bit of sound used in FL Studio, which was a very fun and entertaining
process, especially when all the individual sounds came together in the gameplay.

**Extra Hotkeys**  
G: God mode for ease of testing (much faster fire rate and move rate, cannot die unless aliens touch you). 
M: Mute background music (you will have to restart the game if you want to turn music back on). 
  
**Music and Artwork**  
All original by myself (except font).  
Invaders inspired from official artwork.
